# Project-1-Full-Nagios-Setup

Setting up Nagios for comprehensive system monitoring is a great project. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

# 1. Preparation
Ensure you have a server: Youâ€™ll need a Linux server to install Nagios. A fresh installation of a RHEL-based distribution is ideal.
Update the system: Run sudo yum update to make sure your system is up-to-date.

# 2. Install Required Packages
Install the EPEL repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

sudo yum install epel-release
Install required dependencies:

sudo yum install gcc glibc glibc-common make wget unzip

Configure the Nagios service:

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start nagios
sudo systemctl enable nagios
Verify Nagios status:

sudo systemctl status nagios

# 6. Access Nagios Web UI
Open your web browser and go to http://<your-server-ip>/nagios. Log in with the username nagiosadmin and the password you set during the configuration.

# 7. Configure Monitoring

Edit configuration files: Configuration files are located in /usr/local/nagios/etc/.
